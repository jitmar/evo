// TODO: The current test suite uses GTest, which is robust and widely supported.
// However, for future development, consider evaluating more modern C++ testing
// frameworks like Catch2, doctest, or Boost.Test. They often offer more
// expressive, less macro-heavy syntax that can improve test readability and
// maintainability.
